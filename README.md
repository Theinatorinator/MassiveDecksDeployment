# MassiveDecksDeployment
Based on this repository: https://github.com/Lattyware/massivedecks
This comes with some integrated decks that were originally made for a team that I am part of, but this can still be used for easy deployment when minimal users are expected. I would not use this for anything more than a few small games here and there. I have not tested this on anything more than a local network.
This is a fully self-contained massive deck deployment. There is an associated package.
To launch the fetch package and run the compose. It works best when set up in a docker swarm, meaning that this is technically scalable.
