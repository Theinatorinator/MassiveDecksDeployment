    # Pick your tag wisely for stability. In general, it's best to specify an exact version by commit hash and update manually.
    # Versioned tags are also provided, in order of stability: by version number (major "x", minor "x.y", and patch "x.y.z"), latest-release, latest-prerelease, or latest (head of main).
